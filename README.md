# Kizz

## Features

- Incremental generation

- Guess Tags

    Simply define global tags, and kizz will automatically figure out tags for each file. This is based on the content and path of each file. And great thanks to NaturalNode's general natural language facilities.

    You can, of course, overwrite the tags by define tags in yaml front matter.
