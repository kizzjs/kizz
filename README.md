# Kizz

## What's Difference?

Kizz is somehow more wiki-like and filesystem-oriented.

Designed for SPA.
Assume you have index.html as your template.
And you have source/A.html and source/B.html.
I will compile index.html to destination/A.html and destination/B.html.
So, for you, it's somehow like I redirect all requests to index.html.
So, you can write your single page application easier.

## Warning

Destination folder will be cleaned on site builds.
Files should be put in source folder.
Other files will be removed.
